# MrNewbPhoneTracker

MrNewbPhoneTracker is a resource designed to provide a simple and free alternative for tracking phones within your FiveM server. It features an item called "tracker" that, upon use, prompts the user to search and ping a number to see its current location.

I have only tested this on QBX and it worked with the framework functions provided in defualt qb, this is always subject to change.:

## Features

- **Tracker Item**: The resource introduces an item called "tracker" that allows users to search and ping a number for its current location.
- **Job Locking**: The tracker item is job-locked and configurable according to your server's needs.
- **Community Contribution**: Created as a free alternative, MrNewbPhoneTrackers aims to be a community contribution, offering simplicity and ease of use.

## Compatibility

- **phones**: MrNewbPhoneTrackers is compatible qb-phone, renewed, npwd, lb-phone, gks-phone, yflip, RoadPhone, okok-phone, Jp-Phone, old qs-phone and qs-smartphonepro.
